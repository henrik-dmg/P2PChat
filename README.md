A demo app written as part of my bachelor thesis. It provides implementations for Bonjour, Bluetooth and Multipeer Connectivity to find other devices or advertise themself. Once connected, you exchange chat messages through the established connection.

> I'm not planning on maintaining/releasing this app, but I thought I'd at least publish it. Feel free to steal the code and do whatever with it
